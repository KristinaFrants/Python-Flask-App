    <h1>About This WebApp</h1>
    <p >
        <h5>Thats a basic social network Flask app. User is abble to Register, Login, Logout, Post, Edit and Delete articles. MYSQL Dolphin is used to communicate with a database. </h5><br>
        <h4>Bugs that have been faced while building this app:</h4><br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">
        <li>
            Because no SQLAlchemy is used, I had manually to implement all the requirements for MYSQl and match it with <b>.env</b> file

        </li>
        <li>
           While installing pip, <b>requirements.txt</b> were conflicting with pipfile, so I had to remove <b>pipenv</b> complitelly
        </li>
        <li>
            When deployed to <b>Heroku</b> had to import <b>os</b> and change MYSQL config to match <b>.env</b> and Heroku JawDB for MYSQL
        </li>
        <li> Most of the small bugs were misspeling or missed comma in functions or routes </li>
        <li> For each route an HTML template is created, most components are returned with <b>render_template</b> and helpers</li>
        <li>This app dont have any <b>CSS</b> just bootstrap standart styles</li>
    </div>
